What is LibInsane ?
===================

LibInsane is a library allowing access to image scanners. It is:

* Cross-platform: Linux (Sane), \*BSD (Sane) and Windows (WIA2 & Twain).
* Cross-language: Thanks to `GObject introspection`_.
* Cross-scanner and cross-driver: Because a lot of them all have they quirks (and sometimes bugs).
