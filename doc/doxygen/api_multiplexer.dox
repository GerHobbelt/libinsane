\page api_multiplexer API multiplexer

LibInsane must be able to handle many APIs at once. For instance, on Windows,
it must be able to use WIA2 (low-level and automation) and TWAIN, at the same
time. So it includes an API multiplexer.

The API multiplexer takes many API implementations in input, and merge them
to present them as a single one.
