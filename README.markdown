Libinsane
---------

Libinsane is *the* library to access scanners on both Linux and Windows.

Its main features are:
- Cross-platform: tested on Linux and Windows.
- Cross-API: supports Sane (Linux), WIA2 (Windows) and TWAIN (Windows)
- Cross-scanners: takes care of all the quirks of all the platforms and
  scanners to provide a consistent behaviour everywhere.
- Cross-programming languages: Libinsane a pure C library. It is provided
  with Libinsane-GObject that acts as bindings for many programming.
  languages thanks to [GObject Introspection](https://gi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- Returns the scan as it goes: whenever possible, the image returned by the
  scanner is returned to the application as the scan goes.

It has however some limitations:
- It is only designed to work with *scanners*, not webcams, not USB keys, etc
  (think paper-eaters only)
- TWAIN API or drivers may display some dialogs. Libinsane cannot prevent them.
- Full bed page scan only: Presence of the option to set the scan area cannot
  be guaranteed. You are advised to crop the image later in your own
  application (see [Paperwork](https://openpaper.work) for example).
- 24 bits color scans only (may be fixed later)
- On Windows (both with WIA2 or TWAIN), images are often rotated by 180Â°. This
  is because both APIs return the scan as BMP (DIB), and by default, BMP start
  by the bottom of the image. Since the application must be able to display the
  scan as it goes, Libinsane has to return the image rotated.


It is the successor of [Pyinsane2](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/OpenPaperwork/pyinsane) but shares no code with it.

It is released under [LGPL v3+](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html).
